* Production level application we should create a react application by setting up a react enviroment.

* React enviroment is consist of a javascript transpiler and module bundler.

?> what is transpiler and why we need one well?
>>> react recommends to use the latest version of javascript such as arrow function class 
    syntax and things like that and most browser don't understand this syntax which is why
    we need transpiler.
>>> transpiler convert the one form of code to another form of code.specifically we need a
    transpiler that converts es5 and es6 code to code the browsers understand.

?> what is module bundler and why we need one well?
>>> module bundler takes a bunch of files of different types such as js,image, stylesheet things
    like that and bundles them into a smaller group of files.
>>> Module bundlers are used in react because they help in manage dependency relationship including
    loading modules in the correct order because when you have a really big application loading up your modules
    in correct order can become very cumbersome(large or heavy and therefore difficult to carry or use).
    so now the question

?> what transpiler we use to setup react environment? What is Babel?
>>> the react the javascript transpiler that we will be using is called babel and babel is a javascript compiler
 transpiler that converts ecma script 2015 and plus code into backwards compatible versions of javascript in 
 current and older browser environments.
